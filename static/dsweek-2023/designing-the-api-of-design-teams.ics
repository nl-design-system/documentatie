DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en-GB:DesignOps: designing the API of design teams\nIn
 ayaili León of GitHub\nDesignOps is the glue that keeps a design org toge
 ther\, and the connective tissue that links design to other disciplines ac
 ross the company\, and beyond. Even if your company doesn’t have a forma
 l DesignOps team\, this work is likely being done by someone.\nAt GitHub\,
  we’re thinking about our DesignOps practice as the API that connects de
 signers to designers\, and design to the wider company. Just like when des
 igning APIs\, we’ve tried things that didn’t work quite well\, and hav
 e had to ship several breaking changes as we move towards a more stable re
 lease.\nIn this talk\, you will learn:\n\n   *   How to identify opportuni
 ties for DesignOps to be executed more intentionally\n   *   How to see De
 signOps as an opportunity to connect not just designers\, but design to ot
 her disciplines\, and design to the community\n   *   Some things we’ve 
 tried at GitHub that didn’t work so well — and some that did\n\nInayai
 li León is a Staff Design Program Manager at GitHub\, where she focuses o
 n design operations\, documentation\, and more. Previously\, she was as a 
 Senior Designer at Microsoft\, working on design systems and design ops\, 
 and she led the team creating Canonical's Vanilla design system\n\n\n
