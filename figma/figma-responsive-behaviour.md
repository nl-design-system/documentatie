# Responsive behaviour

To illustrate how a component behaves in multiple viewport size settings [the Figma plugin Breakpoints](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/824289601590456356/Breakpoints) can be used. The behaviour illustrated with this plugin is also available to Figma viewers who do not have the plugin installed. As such, it is only a dependency when you want to create a responsive illustration.

Creating breakpoints and adding components to each individual breakpoint range is relatively easy. [Watch this quick video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGSreqHCXE) to get started.
