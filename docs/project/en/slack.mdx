## Chat channels

- **[#nl-design-system](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C7KDQRXMZ)**: channel for general questions, announcements, and community calls during the [Estafettemodel (Dutch)](/handboek/estafettemodel/).
- **[#nl-design-system-a11y](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C07059B0VK7)**: channel for accessibility specialists to collaborate on [guidelines (Dutch)](/richtlijnen/), accessibility acceptance criteria, and [WCAG pages (Dutch)](/wcag/).
- **[#nl-design-system-content](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C01E0C94QG4)**: channel to reach content creators and collaborate on the [content guidelines (Dutch)](/richtlijnen/content/). It's still a bit quiet here, but that may change soon!
- **[#nl-design-system-designers](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C01D78C2E4E)**: channel to reach designers. You can collaborate here, ask questions about design, UX, Figma, and more. Developers are welcome too!
- **[#nl-design-system-developers](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C01DAT4TRPF)**: channel to reach developers. You can collaborate here, ask questions, announce breaking changes, and more. Designers are also welcome!
- **[#rijkshuisstijl-community](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C05AQK9R41G)**: channel for the [Rijkshuisstijl Community (Dutch)](/community/community-sprints/rijkshuisstijl-community/), where people share knowledge and collaborate on websites that use the [Rijkshuisstijl (Dutch)](http://rijkshuisstijl.nl).

The [Code of Conduct](/coc-en/) applies to all NL Design System channels.

## Huddle

Through Slack, you can make video calls and share your screen with multiple people — this is called a “[Slack Huddle](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/4402059015315-Use-huddles-in-Slack).”
Many people in the community often collaborate via Slack Huddles, so if you hear someone mention a “huddle,” now you know what it is!

## Meetings in Slack

We host many [community meetings (Dutch)](https://nldesignsystem.nl/community/events/overzicht/) via a Slack Huddle. Once you're in Slack, you can join with just one click. You can sign up for various events via our website to receive a calendar invitation and set a reminder.

Community Events that take place in Slack include:

- [Design Open Hour (Dutch)](/events/design-open-hour/)
- [Developer Open Hour (Dutch)](/events/developer-open-hour/)
- [MijnServices (Dutch)](/community/community-sprints/mijn-services-community/) Open Hour
- [Rijkshuisstijl Community Open Hour (Dutch)](/events/rijkshuisstijl-community-open-hour/)
- Rijkshuisstijl Community sprint planning
- Rijkshuisstijl Community sprint retro
