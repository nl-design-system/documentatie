# Slots in Figma

‘Slotting’ is a technique that allow addition or removal of content from a Figma component and have its layout automatically expand or contract based on its content.

This concept can also be utilised to already establish basic guidelines in your design file. A good example of this is a radio button group. Where your UX guidelines likely dictate a maximum number of radio buttons within a single group before suggesting using a different component such as a select menu, you can create a radio button group already restricted to a maximum number of options.

A radio button group component restricted to a maximum of five options would look similar to this, any amount between one and five can be chosen by simply hiding the options not needed:
