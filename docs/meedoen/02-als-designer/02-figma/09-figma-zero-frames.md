# Zero-frames in Figma

‘Zero-frames’ in conjunction with Auto layout is a technique that help with establishing for instance minimum widths or minimum height of elements, similar to how `min-width` and `min-height` is defined in CSS.

This technique comes in handy if, for instance, you want to define a minimum width for buttons or a minimum height for cards.

For an in-depth explanation of this technique see the **[Pushing Figma to its limits** presentation](https://youtu.be/hnPIpkvDxjc?t=79).
