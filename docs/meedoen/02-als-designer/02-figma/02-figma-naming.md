# Naming in Figma

A good approach in any design file is to explicitly name objects directly after their creation. This helps adding meaning to design objects and eases handoff of a design file to another designer or a developer.

For instance, if you create a rectangle meant as background and border container for a text input it is good practice to name the rectangle `text-input-background` or similar right after creating the rectangle.

Where possible, components, layers, frames, and design tokens borrow (semantic) names from HTML and SVG tags, CSS properties, ARIA roles or BEM naming.

## Component variants

For convenience and ‘scanablity’ when working with component variants we suggest using lowercase for boolean values, such as on/off or true/false options and sentence case for interactive and feedback states.

Using the same naming as used in the front-end again eases communication and handoff. For instance for a checkbox’ checked state we use 'checked' instead of 'active'.

In Figma, variant properties can be sorted by dragging and dropping individual properties.

These references also help quickly setting up an interactive prototype.

## Synonyms

Synonyms in the description field help searching for components in libraries.

In below example searching on either select, dropdown, or menu all return the library’s select component.

Descriptions can be set on individual component variants as well.

### Avoid local components from being published to a library

Prefixing a component with an underscore (`_`) prevents it from being published to a shared library. This is especially useful to avoid atomic elements, in use by components but with no use as a reusable standalone element, from being added to a shared library.

In below example searching on ‘checkbox’ returns all components with checkbox in their name. However searching on ‘placeholder’ returns no results.

## Images

Design files are a perfect place to define the intention of images. If an image is decorative, and as such would get a blank `alt=""` alternative text attribute this can be added to its description.

Likewise, if an image is informative to the user, an appropriate `alt` text can already be added as image name. Using the layer to add this image description results in this text being available in Figma’s Layer and Inspect panels.
