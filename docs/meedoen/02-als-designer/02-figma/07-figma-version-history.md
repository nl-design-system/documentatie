# Version history

Version history naming helps with tracking changes.

![Version history overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/248921/140959456-8c2699e7-8641-4fcd-a2e8-da24664ffcc1.png)

## When to save to version history

Figma auto saves files regularly. But it is also possible to explicitely save to Figma’s version history. This allows you to keep track of major changes and makes it easy to see a file’s history and roll back to a previous version when needed.

Major changes (especially breaking changes to components) can also be communicated outside of Figma, for instance on the [NL Design System Figma subchannel](https://codefornl.slack.com/archives/C025HM8V362).

Every time you make a major change to a Figma file you should save it to the version history with a clear description of the changes. To save to Figma’s version history use `File → Save to Version History` or use the keyboard shortcut `⌥ ⌘ S` (MacOS) or `Control + Command + S` (Windows).

A prompt allows you to add a descriptive title and a text fiels to provide more in-depth details of the change(s).

### Using emojis to aid scanning

In order to quickly scan the changes to a file or component consider using emojis in the description, [similar to gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

Some emojis that clearly describe the change are:

- 🆕 to communicate that the component is new
- 🐛 for a bugfix
- 💥 when introducing a breaking change (the component will not work in a similar way as it previously had)
- 💄 to show a style has been changed or updated
- 🩹 for a simple fix
- 🧹 to signify a cleanup
- ♿️ communicates an accessibility improvement
- 🚸 communicates usability improvement
- 📱 work done on viewport responsiveness
- 💫 changes to an imation specifications
- 💀 to deprecate a component
- 🚧 component is a work in progress
- ✏️ fix for a typo
- ⏪️ revert a previous change
