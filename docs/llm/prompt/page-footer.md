# Page Footer component

## Usage

Use the Page Footer component once at the end of the page, for a content that is repeated on multiple web pages.

## HTML and CSS

When you develop a Page Footer component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use a `footer` element as container element, with a `div` element inside of the `footer`.
- The Page Header must have the ARIA landmark role `contentinfo`, which is implied by the HTML element `footer`.
