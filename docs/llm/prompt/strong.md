# Strong component

## Usage

Use the Strong component when strongly emphasising words or phrases, because of urgency or importance.

Do not emphasise entire paragraphs, unless the paragraph is no longer than a short sentence.

## HTML and CSS

When you develop an Strong component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use the appropriate semantic HTML element: `strong`.

## Visual design

- The default font weight must be 700, which is the typical browser default. The default can be implemented as CSS variable fallback.
- To support variable fonts, the `font-weight` must be configurable to any number between 1 and 1000 via a CSS variable.
