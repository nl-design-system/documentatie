# Table component

## Usage

Use the Table component when displaying a grid of at least two rows and two columns, where users need to be able to quickly scan one table column to find the relevant table rows for their use case.

## HTML and CSS

When you develop an Table component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use the appropriate semantic HTML element: `table`, `tbody`, `tr`, `td` and `th` are required. The elements `thead`, `tfoot`, `col` and `caption` are optional.
- Wrap the `table` element inside a `div`, that allows the table to overflow in the text direction.
