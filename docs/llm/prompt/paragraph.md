# Paragraph component

## Usage

Use the paragraph component for each paragraph of text in a block of rich text content.

## HTML and CSS

When you develop a paragraph component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use the appropriate semantic HTML element: `p`.
- The paragraph button must support the following variants:
  - Lead paragraph

## Lead Paragraph variant

The visual design of the Lead Paragraph is typically with a slightly larger font size, a matching line-height and with a bolder font-weight.

## React

In addition to an HTML and CSS implementation, create an implementation of the same component in React:

- Re-use the HTML and CSS from the previous implementation.
- Follow the rules for creating React components.
- Implement the React component with TypeScript and JSX.
