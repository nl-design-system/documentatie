# Code Block component

## HTML and CSS

When you develop a Code Block component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use the appropriate semantic HTML elements: a `code` element nested inside a `pre` element.
- The `pre` element must be able to overflow in the text direction, to fit be able to read wide code blocks on small screens.
- By default, wrap long lines of text.

## Variants

Provide a "no wrap" variant that preserves long lines of text.
