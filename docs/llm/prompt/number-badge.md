# Number Badge

## Usage

Use the Number Badge component when you need a distinctive user interface element to attract to attention to a certain amount of items.

Example usage: number of unread messages.

## HTML and CSS

- Use a `data` element as container element.
- Use the `value` attribute to specify the numeric value. Format the number in the `value` attribute as JSON number.
- The text content of the element must be the numeric value.
- The number must be formatted in the language and locale of the document it is rendered in. Number formatting in the correct locale is important for screen readers to interpret the number correctly, and prevent confusion between the decimal separator and the thousands separator.
