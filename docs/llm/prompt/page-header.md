# Page Header component

## Usage

Use the Page Header component once at the start of the page, for a content that is repeated on multiple web pages.

## HTML and CSS

When you develop a Page Header component with HTML and CSS, use the following requirements:

- Use a `header` element as container element, with a `div` element inside of the `header`.
- The Page Header must have the ARIA landmark role `banner`, which is implied by the HTML element `header`.
