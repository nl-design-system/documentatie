# CSS themes

Set the design of the page using CSS variables. The default method is using a class name on the root element. Do not apply the theme on the `:root`, `html` or `body` selector â€” always use a class name.

The theme class name must be prefixed with the vendor prefix of your organisation. If you have any variations on the theme, such as `light`, `dark` or `compact`, use the BEM modifier class name notation.
