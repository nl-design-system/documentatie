# Introduction into European Design Systems 2025

This April, the User Needs First International Conference will take place in Amsterdam, and we are excited to share that NL Design System will be contributing to the program.
We are eager to take this initiative to initiate a dialogue with the multitude of design systems operating across Europe. Our aim is to identify areas where we can support and learn from one another, fostering a stronger and more connected community.

We will hear from 5 European Design Systems: Denmark, Greece, Italy, Portugal and The Netherlands.

To join the session digitally you can sign up here and add the Teams invite to your calendar.

- 📆 **When**: April 10th from 13:30 to 14:45 CEST.
- 🌍 **Where**: In Amsterdam as part of the [User Needs First International Conference 2025](https://international.gebruikercentraal.nl/conference2025/) and online via Microsoft Teams.
- 🫵 **For you?**: No prior knowledge on design systems is needed. However some introductions might go into technical detail that might be easier to understand for people with prior knowledge of what is involved in creating digital products such as designers and developers.
