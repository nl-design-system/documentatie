# Design Systems Week

<Paragraph lead>
  Design Systems Week is an online event organized by NL Design System. During this week, several short sessions are
  offered in which various (international) organizations share how and why they use design systems. The goal is to bring
  together designers, developers, and other professionals working on digital government services to exchange experiences
  and best practices.
