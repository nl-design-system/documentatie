# Design Systems Week 2025 Program

<Paragraph lead>
  NL Design System is organising the Design Systems Week for the fifth time. It will feature a number of short talks
  about the how and why of design systems. All online. From October 27 to October 30, we will cover subjects like
  managing design systems, integrating accessibility, user research and code.

  <Paragraph>
    TEDI is the design system for the Estonian public sector. What started two years ago as an internal tool quickly
    grew into a system used nationwide. TEDI replaced the previous design system VEERA from 2018, which didn't offer
    components for developers. In this session, the TEDI core team shares their experiences: the successes and the
    challenges. They show how the system is technically structured, how the team works together, and how the design
    library has developed.

<Paragraph>
  Since 2020, extensive work has been done in Luxembourg on three testing methods for accessibility: web, mobile and
  PDF. These practical tests make it easier to check how a website or web application meets the European Standard (EN
  301 549) for digital accessibility. These tests are useful for anyone working with WCAG and are now being used both in
  Luxembourg and internationally as an approach for accessibility audits. Alain will show how these testing methods work
  in practice. He will highlight the key benefits and explain how you can use and contribute to this Open Source
  initiative.

  <Paragraph>
    The Helsinki Design System is an award-winning open-source project, built to be accessible to everyone and available
    in English. This session delves into what it takes to document and scale a design system in practice—covering the
    real challenges of managing documentation workflows, and how to keep collaboration and consistency on track when the
    latest tools aren't available. Gain insight into why process and mindset matter far more than tools, and how
    thoughtful documentation can make or break a design system.
