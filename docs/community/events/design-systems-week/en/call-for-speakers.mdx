# NL Design System Week 2025 - Call for speakers

From October 27th to 31st, 2025, we're once again organizing a week full of sessions on design systems. A week in which we'll share experiences, demonstrate practical applications, and learn together about design, code, guidelines, and collaboration.

Are you a designer, developer, or content creator working with a government design system? Or do you have a great idea to share about the importance of an accessible design system? Then the NL Design System Week is a great opportunity to share knowledge with colleagues.
