# Design Systems Week 2024

<Paragraph lead>
  From 14 to 17 October 2024, NL Design System organises the 4th edition of Design Systems Week. Join us for short talks
  about the **how** and **why** of design systems, from managing design systems to user research and accessibility. This
  year there will be talks both in Dutch and English. Will you join us?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>All talks are online and free to attend. They are about 30 minutes each, including Q&A.</Paragraph>
