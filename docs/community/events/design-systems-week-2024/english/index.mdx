# Design Systems Week 2024

<Paragraph lead>
  From 14 to 17 October 2024, NL Design System organised the 4th edition of Design Systems Week. There were short talks
  about the **how** and **why** of design systems, from managing design systems to user research and accessibility. In
  2024, we had talks both in Dutch and English.
