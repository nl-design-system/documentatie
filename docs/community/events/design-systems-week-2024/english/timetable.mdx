# Timetable Design Systems Week 2024

<Paragraph lead>
  From 2 to 5 October 2024 NL Design System organised the fourth edition of Design Systems Week. Speakers from various
  organisations joined us for short talks about the how and why of design systems. In 2024, there were talks both in
  Dutch and English. For convenience, you can view a{" "}
