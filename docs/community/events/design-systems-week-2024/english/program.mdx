# Program Design Systems Week 2024

<Paragraph lead>
  Design Systems Week featured a number of short talks about the how and why of design systems. All online. In 2024,
  we've covered subjects like managing design systems, integrating accessibility, user research and code.
</Paragraph>

<DSWSession title="Using USWDS Accessibility Tests to Develop Accessibility Skills Across Government Teams" speakers={[speakers.AmyCole]} lang="en" organisation="US Web Design System" headingLevel={2} session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === 'FE871D75-D5C2-4842-A100-71A8A7069FAD')}>

Amy will share plain-language accessibility tests the USWDS team has created for checking the accessibility of individual components. Attendees will learn how any web team — technical or not — can use these tests to perform baseline manual accessibility testing (like keyboard, screen reader, mobile, and zoom magnification testing) on their own sites. She will also describe the team’s iterative design and development process for these checklists, and how other teams can develop their own.

<DSWSession title="Testing UI" speakers={[speakers.GertHengeveld]} lang="en" headingLevel={2}  session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === 'C0639355-E372-422F-8EC9-B069C08CDEEA')}>

<Paragraph>
  Building a Design System is exciting. But once your system is out there being used to power production applications,
  rolling out updates becomes a risky endeavor. Testing is a critical aspect of design systems development and
  maintenance that helps manage those risks. In this talk, Gert explains tools and strategies that help you test your UI
  components and integrations, so your design system can continue to evolve.

<DSWSession title="Design Systems: Choose your own adventure" speakers={[speakers.GeriReid]} organisation="Just Eat Takeaway" lang="en" headingLevel={2} session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === '3A80C3A1-4657-42F8-908D-F9B7565CAF69')}>

Join Geri, a seasoned design systems explorer with 8 years of adventures under her belt, as she navigates the uncharted territories of accessibility in a major product org. With no playbook in hand, Geri’s quest is one we can all relate to: figuring it out as we go along.

In this ‘choose your own adventure’ session, you’ll discover how the principles of design systems can illuminate a path through any new challenge. Come prepared to laugh, learn, and maybe even get a little lost as we embark on a journey of getting teams onboard with digital accessibility.

</DSWSession>

<DSWSession title="CSS for internationalisation" speakers={[speakers.ChenHuiJing]} organisation="" lang="en" headingLevel={2} session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === '6024d4f3-c8fd-4bd5-a06c-36b69a687453')}>

Internationalisation is more than translating the content on your site into multiple languages and calling it a day. There are various nuances to the presentation of that content which affect the experience of a native speaker using your site. There are CSS properties that provide layout and typographic capabilities for scripts and writing systems beyond the Latin-based horizontal top-to-bottom ones that are predominantly seen on the web today.

<DSWSession title="Advantages to working in the open with government design systems" speakers={[speakers.MikeGifford]} organisation="Civic Actions" lang="en" headingLevel={2} session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === 'CE68A449-D6B7-44C2-B114-017668D83998')}>

For many governments, contributing to open source project is culturally a challenge. It often requires engagement with people in other departments and often outside of government. Design systems however provide a unique opportunity for governments to become more confident in their open source adoption. Mike has contributed to several government design systems. As a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer, he is often looking for best practices and comparing different approaches taken by governments around the world.

<DSWSession title="Common direction, boring magic" speakers={[speakers.SteveMesser]} organisation="freelance" lang="en" headingLevel={2} session={sessions.find((session)=> session.uuid === '17A1CBCD-ACB8-4A85-87E4-A4CD258AFABA')}>

Lessons from working on the GOV.‌UK Design System and other common platforms in UK government. How leaning on the principles that make the Web great can create more value for the public we serve.
